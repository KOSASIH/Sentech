# About Sentech

We’re building the infrastructure for digital currency and tokenized asset management, but we’re also going to provide a platform for derivatives trading. We’re hoping to get institutional investors involved in digital currencies and help them manage their assets.

We want to address issues in the crypto community like liquidity, custody, trade settlement, legal compliance and security. To do that we’ll need to make sure that the platform is decentralized so custody doesn't become an issue (like it did with Mt. Gox).

We want to make sure that there is no single point of failure so if one server goes down, our users can still access their data. It also means that no single entity controls the network, which should help make sure that transactions are secure and safe from hacking.

Because we want to be compliant with laws and regulations, we'll need to make sure that we know who our users are and what they're doing on our platform at all times. This way there's no question about whether or not they're obeying regulations or trying something illegal like money laundering.
We're thrilled to announce the launch of Sentech, a decentralized application for digital currency and tokenized asset management, as well as derivatives trading.

Sentech is a blockchain application that's built on the Ethereum platform. It's basically a peer-to-peer application that enables users to exchange and trade digital currency and tokenized assets, as well as derivatives.

By using smart contracts, it provides its users with streamlined, self-executing interactions that are secured by cryptographic protocols. These types of contracts have been used in the past for simple things like purchases of products or services, but we've taken it to the next level. We think you'll be blown away at how much more you can do with it now!
